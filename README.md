# The Comp sci 311 entire lab
It is a  pain in the ass to understand what the instructions of our labs are talking about especially when you met a terrible professor like i did.<br>
I was really painful for me to finish some of the labs, so hopefully my version of the lab can help our future fellows.<br>
<b>GOOD LUCK, YOU CAN DO IT</b>
